* Environment setup

Download and install Go (from https://golang.org/dl/):

    tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz

Three environmental variables:

    $GOROOT -> /usr/local/go
    $PATH   -> $GOROOT/bin:$PATH
    $GOPATH -> /home/pslomka/go
    $GOBIN  -> /home/pslomka/go/bin

Task *#1*

    go run tasks/workshop1/main.go
    go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
    go install github.com/slomek/go-workshops/tasks/workshop1

Test your env:

    $GOBIN/workshop1


* Creating modules

Main application file should be in `main` package.

    package main
    ...

Package names are important, as they are used with all imported functions etc.

    ...
    import "fmt"
    ...
        fmt.Println("Hello Siilis!")

Package names _should_ match directory names
(You will save a lot of time!)

* Importing between modules

All imported stuff is referenced by `packagename.stuffname`:

    fmt.Println()

Note that you can only import things starting with a capital letter!

Task *#2*

    go test github.com/slomek/go-workshops/tasks/workshop2/fb
